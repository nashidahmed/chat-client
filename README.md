# WebSocket Chat Client

WebSocket Chat is a simple, secure user-friendly Hop-On Hop-Off chat application designed to seamlessly integrate the power of real-time conversation using WebSockets with end to end encryption. To view the server code, click [here](https://github.com/nashidahmed/chat-server).

The app allows any user to connect and view all the users currently connected to the server. The user can then securely share messages with other users connected to the server. Messages are secured using a key pair generated when the user first connects to the server.
